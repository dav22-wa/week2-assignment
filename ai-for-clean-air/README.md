# AI for Clean Air – Clustering Urban Air Pollution

### ✅ SDG Goal: Sustainable Cities (SDG 11)

### 📌 Problem
Air pollution in urban areas leads to respiratory diseases and poor quality of life. We use machine learning to group cities based on pollution and health indicators to target clean-air efforts.

### 🧠 ML Method
- **Type**: Unsupervised Learning
- **Algorithm**: K-Means Clustering

### 📊 Dataset
Pollution data with features like:
- PM2.5 concentration
- Population density
- Income level
- Green area %

### 🛠️ Tools
Python, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib

### 🔍 Key Results
- Cities are clustered into 3 pollution groups: High, Medium, Low
- Visual maps and cluster insights guide policy

### ⚖️ Ethical Notes
Bias in urban data (e.g., underreporting in poor regions) may lead to unfair prioritization.
